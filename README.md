# 🚀 BLOCKLIFT

## 🌟 Project Overview

**BlockLift** is a blockchain-powered social impact initiative focused on connecting education and opportunity in underserved communities across Nigeria.

Our core mission is to **"lift communities through education"** by providing essential school materials (bags, sandals, notebooks) to children in public schools. We solve the problem of trust and transparency in charitable giving by recording every single donation and delivery on the Bitcoin blockchain via **Stacks**.

### Why BlockLift?

- **Verifiable Impact:** Every donation generates an **NFT Proof of Impact** (a digital receipt) that donors can verify instantly on our public dashboard.
- **Web3 Literacy:** We actively introduce students and communities to Web3, Bitcoin, and decentralized technology, fostering the next generation of innovators.
- **Absolute Transparency:** We ensure 100% accountability by making all transactions and verification data publicly traceable on the chain.
