  "content": "# Why Stacks is Secured by Bitcoin\n\nStacks is a Bitcoin Layer 2 that brings smart contracts and decentralized applications to Bitcoin without modifying Bitcoin itself.\n\n## The Proof of Transfer (PoX) Mechanism\n\nStacks uses a novel consensus mechanism called **Proof of Transfer (PoX)** that anchors to Bitcoin's security.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Bitcoin Commitment**: Stacks miners commit Bitcoin to participate in leader election\n2. **Block Production**: Selected miners write new Stacks blocks\n3. **Bitcoin Settlement**: Each Stacks block's hash is written to Bitcoin\n4. **Inheritance of Security**: The Bitcoin blockchain becomes a source of truth for Stacks\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n### Leveraging Bitcoin's Security\nBitcoin has the most secure blockchain in the world, backed by immense computational power. By anchoring to Bitcoin, Stacks inherits this security.\n\n### No Forking Bitcoin\nStacks achieves smart contract functionality without requiring any changes to Bitcoin's base layer, maintaining Bitcoin's security and stability.\n\n### STX Token Economics\nSTX holders can participate in consensus by Stacking their tokens, earning Bitcoin rewards in return for helping secure the network.\n\n## Smart Contracts on Bitcoin\n\nStacks brings programmability to Bitcoin through:\n- **Clarity smart contracts**: A decidable language designed for safety\n- **Bitcoin interactions**: Contracts can read Bitcoin state and trigger based on Bitcoin transactions\n- **Decentralized apps**: Full-featured dApps that leverage Bitcoin's security\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- **DeFi on Bitcoin**: Lending, borrowing, and trading secured by Bitcoin\n- **NFTs with Bitcoin backing**: Digital assets with Bitcoin's longevity guarantees\n- **Decentralized identity**: Self-sovereign identity anchored to Bitcoin\n- **Impact verification**: Like BlockLift's proof-of-impact system\n\nBy building on Stacks, developers can create sophisticated applications while benefiting from Bitcoin's unmatched security and network effects."
