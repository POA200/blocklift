  "content": "# The STX Token Explained\n\nSTX is the native cryptocurrency of the Stacks blockchain, serving multiple critical functions in the ecosystem.\n\n## Core Functions\n\n### 1. Transaction Fees\nAll transactions on the Stacks network require STX to pay for gas fees, similar to how Ethereum uses ETH.\n\n### 2. Smart Contract Execution\nDeploying and executing smart contracts costs STX, compensating miners for computational resources.\n\n### 3. Stacking (Consensus Participation)\nSTX holders can \"Stack\" their tokens by locking them for a period to:\n- Help secure the network\n- Earn Bitcoin rewards\n- Participate in governance\n\n### 4. Token Registration\nCreating new tokens or NFTs on Stacks requires STX.\n\n## Stacking: Earning Bitcoin\n\nThe Stacking mechanism is unique to Stacks:\n\n1. **Lock STX**: Commit your tokens for reward cycles\n2. **Support Miners**: Your locked STX signals support for honest miners\n3. **Earn BTC**: Receive Bitcoin rewards as miners transfer BTC to Stackers\n4. **Compound Growth**: Use earned BTC to acquire more STX if desired\n\n## Tokenomics\n\n- **Total Supply**: Capped at a maximum of ~1.82 billion STX\n- **Distribution**: Through mining and early allocation\n- **Inflation**: Decreasing over time as the network matures\n- **Deflation Mechanisms**: Transaction fees are burned in some cases\n\n## Governance\n\nSTX holders have a voice in network upgrades and parameters through community governance processes.\n\n## Getting STX\n\nYou can acquire STX through:\n- Cryptocurrency exchanges\n- Mining (running a Stacks node)\n- Earning through dApp participation\n- Direct purchase via services like Boom Wallet\n\n## Real-World Value\n\nSTX derives value from:\n- Network utility (required for all network operations)\n- Bitcoin yield (through Stacking)\n- Growing ecosystem adoption\n- Speculation on future network growth\n\nUnderstanding STX is essential for anyone building on or participating in the Stacks ecosystem."
