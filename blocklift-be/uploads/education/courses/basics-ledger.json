  "content": "# What is a Decentralized Ledger?\n\nA decentralized ledger is a database that is distributed across multiple locations, institutions, or participants. Unlike traditional centralized databases, no single entity has complete control over the entire ledger.\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\n### 1. Distributed Storage\nThe ledger is replicated across multiple nodes in a network. Each node maintains its own copy of the entire ledger.\n\n### 2. Consensus Mechanism\nNodes must agree on the state of the ledger through a consensus algorithm. This ensures that all copies remain synchronized and accurate.\n\n### 3. Immutability\nOnce data is recorded and confirmed, it becomes extremely difficult to alter or delete. This creates a permanent and tamper-evident record.\n\n### 4. Transparency\nMost decentralized ledgers are transparent, allowing anyone to view the transaction history and verify the integrity of the data.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **No single point of failure**: The system continues to operate even if some nodes go offline\n- **Censorship resistance**: No single authority can prevent transactions or access\n- **Trust minimization**: Participants don't need to trust each other, only the protocol\n- **Auditability**: All transactions are recorded and can be independently verified\n\n## Real-World Applications\n\nDecentralized ledgers power cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, enable smart contracts on platforms like Stacks, and are being explored for supply chain tracking, identity management, and more."
