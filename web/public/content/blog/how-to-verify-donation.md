# How to Verify Your Donation on the Stacks Blockchain

One of BlockLift's core features is **complete transparency**. Every donation you make can be verified on the Stacks blockchain, giving you cryptographic proof that your contribution was recorded and linked to real-world impact.

This guide will walk you through the verification process step-by-step.

## Step 1: Make a Donation

Visit our [Sponsor Page](/sponsor) and choose your donation method:

- **Paystack** (for NGN donations)
- **PayPal** (for USD donations)
- **Crypto** (for direct Stacks/Bitcoin payments)

After completing your payment, you'll receive a **confirmation email** with your transaction reference.

## Step 2: Access the Impact-Chain Dashboard

Navigate to our [Dashboard](/dashboard) to view your donation status.

### What You'll See:

- **Impact Metrics**: Total donations, students impacted, supplies distributed
- **Verify Impact Card**: Enter your transaction reference to verify your donation
- **Latest Blockchain Distributions**: See recent distributions recorded on-chain

## Step 3: Enter Your Transaction Reference

In the **Verify Impact** card, paste your transaction reference (provided in your confirmation email) and click **Verify**.

The system will:

1. Look up your transaction on the Stacks blockchain
2. Display the transaction status (Verified/Pending)
3. Show the link to the full transaction on **Stacks Explorer**

## Step 4: View on Stacks Explorer

Click the **Explorer Link** to view your transaction on the public Stacks blockchain.

### What You'll See on Stacks Explorer:

- **Transaction Hash (TxID)**: Unique identifier for your transaction
- **Block Height**: The Bitcoin block where your transaction was anchored
- **Contract Call Details**: The function called on our Clarity smart contract
- **Timestamp**: When the transaction was confirmed
- **Sender Address**: Your wallet address (if paying via crypto)

## Step 5: Check the NFT (Optional)

If you donated via crypto using a Stacks wallet, you'll also receive a **Proof of Impact NFT** in your wallet.

To view it:

1. Open your Stacks wallet (e.g., Boom Wallet, Leather)
2. Navigate to the **NFT** or **Collectibles** section
3. Look for the **BlockLift Proof of Impact** NFT

The NFT metadata will include:

- Donation amount
- Distribution event linked to your donation
- School name and location
- Supply type

## Why This Matters

This level of transparency ensures that:

- **Your donation was recorded**: The blockchain provides immutable proof.
- **Funds reached the intended recipients**: Distribution data is verified by our Ambassador network.
- **You own the proof**: The NFT is yours to keep as a permanent record of your impact.
