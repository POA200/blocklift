# Stacks NFT Impact Explained: How BlockLift Uses Bitcoin-Secured Proof

BlockLift is pioneering a new model of transparent charity by leveraging the **Stacks blockchain** to create immutable, Bitcoin-secured **Proof of Impact NFTs**. In this post, we'll explain how this technology works and why it matters for donors, recipients, and the future of social impact.

## What is Stacks?

Stacks is a **Layer 2 blockchain** that brings smart contracts and decentralized applications to Bitcoin. Unlike other blockchains, Stacks transactions are settled on the Bitcoin blockchain, inheriting Bitcoin's unmatched security and permanence.

This means that every BlockLift donation and distribution event is not just recorded on a blockchain—it's **anchored to Bitcoin**, the most secure and decentralized network in the world.

## How BlockLift Creates Proof of Impact

When a donation is made through BlockLift (whether via Paystack, PayPal, or direct crypto), the following happens:

1. **Donation Recorded**: The donation is processed and verified by our trusted NGO and Ambassador network.
2. **Smart Contract Call**: A transaction is sent to our Clarity smart contract on Stacks Layer 2.
3. **NFT Minted**: A unique **Proof of Impact NFT** is generated, representing your specific contribution.
4. **Bitcoin Settlement**: The transaction is settled on the Bitcoin blockchain, making it permanent and immutable.

## Why NFTs for Impact?

Unlike traditional receipts or certificates, **Proof of Impact NFTs**:

- **Cannot be altered or deleted**: Once on the blockchain, the record is permanent.
- **Are publicly verifiable**: Anyone can view the transaction on the Stacks Explorer.
- **Are owned by you**: The NFT is sent to your wallet, giving you cryptographic proof of your contribution.
- **Link to real-world impact**: Each NFT contains metadata linking to the specific school, supply type, and distribution event.

## Transparency You Can Trust

With BlockLift, you don't have to trust us to report impact—you can **verify it yourself** on the blockchain. Every donation, every distribution, every supply delivered is recorded on-chain and linked to a unique transaction ID.

This level of transparency is unprecedented in the charity sector and represents the future of accountable, donor-driven impact.
