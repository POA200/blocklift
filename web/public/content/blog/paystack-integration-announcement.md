# Announcing Paystack Integration: Donate with Naira, Verify on Bitcoin

We're excited to announce a major update to BlockLift: **Paystack integration**, making it easier than ever for Nigerian donors to contribute while still benefiting from blockchain transparency.

## Why Paystack?

While BlockLift was built on blockchain technology, we recognize that many potential donors in Nigeria are more comfortable with traditional payment methods. **Paystack** is one of Nigeria's most trusted payment processors, supporting:

- **Bank transfers**
- **Card payments**
- **USSD codes**
- **Mobile money**

By integrating Paystack, we're lowering the barrier to entry while maintaining the transparency that makes BlockLift unique.

## How It Works

When you donate via Paystack:

1. **Pay in Naira**: Use your preferred payment method (bank transfer, card, etc.) to donate in NGN.
2. **We Verify**: Our team verifies the payment and coordinates with our Ambassador network.
3. **Blockchain Record**: Once your donation is linked to a distribution event, we record it on the Stacks blockchain.
4. **You Get Proof**: You receive a transaction reference and can verify the impact on our [Dashboard](/dashboard).

## Same Transparency, Easier Process

Even though you're paying in Naira through Paystack, your donation still gets the same blockchain verification as a direct crypto payment:

- **On-chain record** of the distribution event
- **Transaction ID** you can look up on Stacks Explorer
- **Proof of Impact** linked to a specific school and supply delivery

## PayPal Too!

In addition to Paystack, we've also integrated **PayPal** for international donors who prefer to donate in USD. The same verification process applies.

## Conversion Rates

When you donate in NGN via Paystack, the amount is converted to USD using **live exchange rates** from a trusted API. This ensures fair conversion and accurate blockchain records.

You can see the conversion rate displayed on the payment page before confirming your donation.

## Getting Started

Visit our [Pay Page](/pay) to see all available payment options:

- **Paystack** (NGN, best for Nigerian donors)
- **PayPal** (USD, best for international donors)
- **Crypto** (STX/BTC, for blockchain-native donors)

Each option provides the same level of transparency and verification.

## The Future of Accessible Impact

Our goal is to make transparent, verifiable charity accessible to everyone—regardless of their familiarity with blockchain technology.

Paystack integration is a big step toward that vision, and we're excited to see more Nigerian donors join the BlockLift community.
