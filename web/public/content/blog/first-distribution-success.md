# Success Story: Our First Major School Supply Distribution

We're thrilled to share a major milestone: **BlockLift's first large-scale distribution event**, which brought essential school supplies to **500 students across 5 schools** in Lagos.

## The Challenge

Many schools in Lagos communities operate with limited resources. Students often lack basic supplies like notebooks, pens, school bags, and sandals. This creates barriers to learning and puts additional financial pressure on families.

When we launched BlockLift, our goal was to address this need with a **transparent, verifiable distribution model** powered by blockchain technology.

## The Distribution

Over the course of two weeks, our Ambassador network coordinated distributions to:

- **St. Mary's Primary School** (Ikeja): 125 students received bags, notebooks, and sandals
- **Community High School** (Surulere): 85 students received bags, textbooks, and pencil sets
- **Bright Future Academy** (Yaba): 150 students received bags, uniforms, and shoes
- **Unity Primary School** (Mushin): 95 students received bags, water bottles, and notebooks
- **Knowledge Gate School** (Lekki): 110 students received bags, lunch boxes, and pens

Each distribution was documented with photos, student counts, and verified supply lists.

## The Blockchain Verification

Within 24 hours of each distribution, our team submitted the verified data to our **Clarity smart contract** on Stacks. Donors who contributed to these distributions received **Proof of Impact NFTs**, allowing them to verify their contribution on the blockchain.

## What the Schools Are Saying

**Principal Okafor** from Community High School shared: "The transparency of this process is incredible. Parents can see exactly what their school received, and the blockchain record gives us confidence that the system is fair and accountable."

## The Numbers

- **500 students impacted**
- **5 schools served**
- **1,200+ individual supply items distributed**
- **100% on-chain verification**
- **5 Proof of Impact NFTs minted**

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. With continued donor support, we plan to expand to **10 additional schools** in Q1 2026 and explore new supply categories like technology equipment and library books.
