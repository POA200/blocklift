# What is a Decentralized Ledger?

A decentralized ledger is a database replicated across many nodes. No single party controls it, and consensus rules determine how new entries are added.

Key ideas:

- Peer-to-peer replication
- Cryptographic integrity
- Transparent, append-only history

Bitcoin pioneered a robust decentralized ledger through Proof of Work and economic incentives.
